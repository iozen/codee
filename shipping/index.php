                    For international shipments, we use proven freight forwarders such as TNT, DHL or UPS. In order to handle
                    the journey and protect our products from potential damage, we make sure that they are packed sufficiently.

                    Our prices don't include shipping costs. They will be added to your order during checkout. Please note

                    If your delivery country charges local taxes or customs duties - these will be charged once the package
                    reaches the destination country. You will have to pay these charges. This also applies to the purchase of
                    gifts or other purchases made on behalf of another recipient.

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, we have no control over customs fees and we cannot inform you how much they will be before
                    you order. Customs policies vary widely from country to country. Please contact your local customs office
                    for further information.

                    After you have received the items you ordered, you may carefully examine and try the items within the
                    period of 14 days, but only in a manner as you would if you examined the products in our store or any
                    other offline reseller. If the items or packing have been used in excess of what is normal in order to
                    examine them, you will be held liable for the decrease in value of the items the use has caused. When we
                    have received the items, we will notify you if there is any loss of value of the product and if your refund
                    will be lower than the price paid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we accept your return order as valid and the product can be re-sold as new, you will be entitled to
                    receive an exchange or a refund, which will not include the expenses on back and forth logistics. The
                    refund will be paid back within 14 days of receiving the notification of your wish to return the order.
                    However the refund will not be paid before we have received the items at our warehouse.
